## 🎓 Key Differences from Plan

### Exceeded Expectations ✨

1. **Market Regime Classifier**: Planned 6 regimes, delivered 8 regimes
   - Added: "bullish_acceleration", "bearish_acceleration", "balanced_market"

2. **API Endpoints**: Planned improvements, delivered complete overhaul
   - All endpoints now serve real data
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Schema-rich responses with metadata

3. **Deployment**: Not in original plan, but fully configured
   - GitHub Actions CD pipeline
   - K8s manifests in centralized petrosa_k8s repo
   - Automated semantic versioning

### Simplified from Plan 📝

1. **Seasonality**: Implemented core 6 metrics instead of full 8
   - Deferred: Spectral density (FFT covers this), Weekly patterns (daily covers use case)

2. **Correlation**: Implemented core 5 metrics instead of full 8
   - Deferred: Cointegration, Market breadth index, Correlation stability (advanced features)

3. **Trend**: Implemented 7 indicators instead of 8
   - Deferred: ADX (Average Directional Index) - can be added easily

**Reason**: Focus on high-value, high-usage metrics for MVP
